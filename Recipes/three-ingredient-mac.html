    <p>While boxed mac n cheese is quick, economical, and easy, it leaves quite a lot to be desired in the flavor department.
        While you might consider going all out and whipping up an artisanal mac with expensive cheese and increase TTM (time to mac), there is a better solution.
    This three ingredient mac n cheese gives you the taste and quality of homemade mac n cheese, in the same amount of time the boxed stuff takes. </p>
    <p>Using a bit of food science and cooking technique, you can have excellent mac n cheese in under 15 minutes.</p>
