        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>1 24oz Bone in Ribeye steak (preferably 2in thick)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Canola Oil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>3 sprigs of thyme</li>
            <li>2 sprigs of rosemary</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season generously with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot, about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.</li>
                <li>Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, until a dark crust has formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to opposite side of the skillet, tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>Slice the steak against the grain and serve.</li>
            </ol>
