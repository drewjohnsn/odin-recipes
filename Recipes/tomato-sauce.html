    <p>After cooking for a while, you start to pick up on a few dishes that the cheap and easy method just isn't worth the convenience. For me, that was tomato sauce. While this takes a significantly higher amount of time than a jar of Prego, the results are absolutely worth it â€“ and most of the time is inactive anyway! </p>
    <p>I can not overstate how important good tomatoes are for this recipe. <em>USE GOOD SAN MARZANO OR SAN MARZANO STYLE TOMATOES.</em></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>8oz Elbow Macaroni</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure out equal parts (8oz in this case) of elbow macaroni, evaporated milk, and freshly grated medium cheddar</li>
            <li>Add pasta to a saucepan and add enough water to cover just over the pasta</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil</li>
            <li>Boil the pasta until almost all the liquid has almost completely evaporated, stirring occasionally</li>

            <li>Stir in the grated cheese until thoroughly combined</li>
