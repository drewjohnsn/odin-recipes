    <p>After cooking for a while, you start to pick up on a few dishes that the cheap and easy method just isn't worth the convenience. For me, that was tomato sauce. While this takes a significantly longer time than a jar of Prego, the results are absolutely worth it â€“ and most of the time is inactive anyway! </p>
    <p>I can not overstate how important good tomatoes are for this recipe. <em>USE GOOD SAN MARZANO OR SAN MARZANO STYLE TOMATOES.</em></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>28oz can of good San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>5 Tbsp of Butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</gili>
        <li>1 pound of pasta (I like spaghetti or fettucine, but sub your favorite shape and it should be fine!</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add your 28oz can of tomatoes to a saucepot over medium heat.</li>
            <li> Split your onion in half, remove stems and skins, add to the pot along with 5 tbsps of butter.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt and bring to a simmer</li>
            <li>Simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the pot gets too hot or it bubbles too much, slightly reduce the heat.</li>
            <li> Once they begin to soften, crush the tomatoes on the wall of the saucepan.</li>
            <li>After 45 minutes have elapsed, taste the sauce for seasoning. Add any necessary salt, remove the onions from the pan.</li>
            <li>Opt. use an immersion blender to create a finer consistency.</li>
            <li>Remove sauce from the saucepan and palce in a skillet. Keep warm over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Boil a pound of pasta in very salty water until al dente, usually 1-2 minutes before package instructions.</li>
            <li>Using tongs, add your pasta to the pan with the sauce and toss to evenly coat the pasta.</li>
            <li>Serve in a warm bowl with grated parmasan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
